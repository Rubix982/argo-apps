# Autoscaling with Argo Workflows + Kubernetes HPA

## Description

Integrate workflows that monitor workloads and trigger autoscaling.

## What to Include

- Run workflows to measure CPU/memory usage.
- Use Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) or KEDA for scaling.
- Example: A CPU-heavy data processing task triggers an autoscale.

## What You'll Learn

- Automating scaling decisions based on real metrics.
- Building data-driven autoscaling workflows.
- Connecting workflows with cluster-level metrics.
